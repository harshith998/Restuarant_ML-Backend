    "text": "While on vacation I decided to have a nice brunch here. I heard great things about the restaurant and they definitely did not disappoint!! First off the restaurant was very big on the inside and they had a really nice patio! I am definitely a patio girl but it was very busy on a Sunday so we sat inside. The decor and ambiance was very nice and tropical, our wait was only 15 minutes and we had great service. They have an amazing menu so it was hard to pick what to eat. I ordered the lobster omelet and a side of French toast. It also came with home fries. It was sooooo good. The omelet had lobster AND shrimp and had this really tasty hollandaise sauce drizzled all over it. So delicious. My boyfriend ordered the salted caramel banana stuffed French toast and OMG. It was so decadent and delicious. Even the side of eggs and sausage were so tasty. They also have a wide selection of specialty mimosas, I ordered the strawberry pineapple mimosa and it was really good. Next time I'll try the mimosa flightThis place was amazing and definitely a go to brunch spot while in Myrtle beach",

Let's just say that the reviews did not lie one bit and this place is now one of my favorite out of town gems.Service: thank YOU to Kaitlyn (or with a C) for her excellent recommendations with everything from beverages to food. She was attentive and made it her duty to check in on us the entire time.Ambiance: the decor was super cute and did I mention that they have both open and enclosed outdoor seating? How perfect for a beautiful summer day.Drinks: my boyfriend and I decided to order two flights so I'll list them out and rate them to save time:Seasonal Mimosas:Kiss from a Rose: 2nd FavoriteLove Bomb: least favoriteSt. Valentine: 3rd FavoriteLove potion: FAVORITEClassics:Classic: least favorite (the pulp orange juice didn't really mesh)Hawaiian: FAVORITETropical: 2nd favoriteCherry bomb: least favoriteFood:Mines: Crème Brûlée French Toast-two slices of French toast, berry compote, crème anglaise, Chantilly cream, and fresh berries (menu description) paired with a side of bacon.The French toast was DIVINE and a guilty pleasure to help balance off the mimosas. What I didn't really appreciate was the bacon because the price and quantity was a little off and we paid a lot for 3 small strips. Overall I give it 10 forks and a satisfied tummy.My boyfriend: my boyfriend ordered the Bacon Avocado Omelette- hickory smoked bacon, spinach, tomatoes, jack cheddar and diced avocado (menu description) paired with a side of wheat toast and home fries. His omelette was SCRUMPTIOUS and oh so filing. Well seasoned, perfect blend of flavors, and a generous serving of bacon inside. His home fries were golden brown, crunchy, and tasty as well. He gave his omelette 10 forks, 10 knives, and a satisfied tummy craving it the next day.No dessert! We were stuffed from a hearty and delicious breakfast and those mimosas.Do yourself a favor, hurry over to Mimosas and order themimosa flight, you won't be disappointed!",

If you love starting your day with great food, good vibes, and the perfect amount of bubbles (yes, I'm talking about those mimosas), this is the spot for you!First off, the menu. You ever look at a menu and just know you're about to have a hard time choosing because everything sounds so good? That's Mimosa's. From thefluffy pancakesto the savory omelets, it's like they read my brunch dreams and turned them into reality. Pro tip: Don't skip the French toast. Trust me, it's worth every calorie (and then some).Let's talk mimosas because, hello, it's in the name. They don't play around here. Whether you're into classic OJ or want to get fancy with a splash of cranberry, they've got you covered. Also, they definitely don't skimp on the champagne. It's like they've decided \"brunch\" means \"celebration,\" and I'm here for it.And the staff? Friendly, fast, and they never judge when you order that second (or third) round of mimosas before noon. Respect.Long story short: Mimosa's is the brunch spot you never knew you needed in your life. Just make sure to set an alarm--or five--because you won't want to sleep in and miss out on this!",

    "text": "I'm a local and have frequently gone to this restaurant as it is one of my favorites.  Unfortunately, on my last visit, I sent my sandwich back to the kitchen.  It was returned with a dead fly on the plate!  Seriously!!  Clearly, someone in the kitchen was mad that the sandwich was sent back and out of spite added some unnecessary \"protein\" to the plate.  This was off season when they weren't even crowded.  Needless to say, I will not return.",

Their eggs are absolutely cooked to perfection, their drinks are always on point (some of the mimosas are on the sweet side but still amazing) and their breakfast items are ALL good. The wait staff is always kind and the place is always clean and beautiful (including their bathrooms). Will always be my family's favorite return breakfast spot,",

    "text": "THIS PLACE IS BOMB!!! We had the BEST server and the food was delicious. Listen to me... if you are a cookie dough fan.. DO NOT skip the cookie dough French toast. Drool, it was SO good. I had the strawberry pineapple mimosa--also a solid choice. The portions are huge so we were super full half way through. The inside is beautiful. Our seat had crumbs and a fork on it when we were sat, which originally had us worried but the food was worth it. It will be a MUST go back on every trip now. If I could give this place a 10 star I would.",

    "text": "Our family had breakfast at Mimosas not once but twice while vacationing in Myrtle! The decor is super cute and festive!  Both indoor and outdoor seating options are available. The food was outstanding and the portions were large! Our favorites included the Gypsy Skillet, Chunky Lobster Scram-blette, Sante Fe Skillet and our absolute favorite was the Birria Hash! The drinks were fun, colorful and they do not skimp on the alcohol! The food came out in a timely manner.  The service was just average. No complaints but also nothing to write home about.  Cannot wait to return when we are back in the area!",

    "text": "This place was amazing! Our regular breakfast place was closed on a Sunday, so we decided to give Mimosa's a try and we are so glad we did! The atmosphere is open and festive, and even though they were busy, we never felt rushed, the waitstaff was all walking around with smiles on their faces and the manager took the time to ask how our experience was going.The food matched the atmosphere. Great selection of both sweet and savory dishes (you def should try the beignets), and of course the mimosas were terrific. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "I had read all of the wonderful reviews about Mimosas and was so excited when  we were able to get a table today at 1030 am.  The restaurant is huge!  There are several rooms and outside seating too.  Everyone  that worked there was very friendly and polite,   This place reminded me of a mix of Famous Toastery and Blueberry Grill.  I really enjoyed my breakfast.   There wasn't a lot of healthy options but I went with the lobster omelette.  It was a very large size.   It came with home fries, fruit or grits.   I went with the grits and wheat toast.   Those were both good, too.  I was only able to eat 1/4 of the whole meal due to how big it was (which isn't a bad thing.) I also  ordered a Bloody Mary which was garnished well.   My friend has a delicious mimosa.   For her meal, She had a lobster, shrimp and bacon scramble.  She liked it very much.  The croissants were unique but she liked it.  This is a very good breakfast spot and I can see why it is well liked.   It was just missing something for the 5 strap \"it factor\".   I so recommend it very much? Though!",

Had gluten friendly pancakes with a lobster omelette . Not big on good runners since my friends one meal was served with missing items . We didn't have any alcoholic drinks but the flight of mimosas looked amazing . Little pricey but the food was hot and very good . Great first experience .",

    "text": "Recently had a neighborhood ladies' lunch at Mimosas/Myrtle Bch, SC. We were all seated outside on the covered veranda. It was quite lovely except there is a lot of road noise from the traffic. Ordered the Grownup Grilled Cheese with the fruit bowl. Absolutely delicious. The tomato jam gave a nice kick to the sandwich. Wish I could take some home. Would definitely order this again. There were 30 ladies who attended the lunch and the restaurant was packed so it took a while to get our lunches but worth the wait.Please check your receipt. They automatically add a 20% tip to your bill and then there is an additional line on your receipt to add an additional tip. If you aren't paying attention you could be paying 2 tips. This is a totally shady business practice and I hope the restaurant removes it. This is why I didn't give the business 5 stars.",
