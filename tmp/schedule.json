Because there were no specific time slot requirements or shifts defined for this period, I prioritized a balanced distribution of hours to ensure no single employee is overburdened. To improve future results, please input specific shift times and staff preferences so I can better optimize for peak periods and individual work-life balance.","published_at":null,"created_at":"2026-01-18T01:15:09.122901","updated_at":"2026-01-18T01:15:10.901103","items":[]}
